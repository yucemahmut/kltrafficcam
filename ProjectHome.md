KL Traffic Cam is an Android 1.5 application. It's a simple application that provides easy access to excellent video feeds provided by ITIS (http://www.itis.com.my/atis/index.jsf). No fancy stuff here - an Intent is published with the video feed URI. This triggers an Android's built-in video component to start streaming video (which actually works better than expected). The application also provides an embedded web view for quick access to ITIS' WAP site and a favorites list. Also available on SlideMe (http://slideme.org/application/kl-traffic-cam) and Android Market (http://www.cyrket.com/p/android/my.codeandroid.itisvid/)

Tested on
**Android 1.5 Emulator** HTC Dream running Cyanogen MOD (Android 1.6)
**Nexus One (Android 2.1)** Nexus One (Android 2.2)
